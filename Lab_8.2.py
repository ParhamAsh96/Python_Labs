"""  Lab 8 -----> Level 2

<<   List   >>

Ask the user to type 5 exam scores (0 â€“ 100), and 5 names of students. Each name should have a corresponding score 
(e.g., the first grade is for the first student, and so on). Your program should:
Print the average score for the students.
Print the name of the student with the highest score. In case there is a tie return the last instance.
